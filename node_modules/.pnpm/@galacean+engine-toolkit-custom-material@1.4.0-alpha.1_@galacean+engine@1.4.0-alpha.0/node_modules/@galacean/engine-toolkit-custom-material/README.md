# Custom Material

The `Custom Material` toolkit provides a variety of special materials, such as infinite grids and planar shadows, etc.
However, the material of this warehouse will either rely on the control of the `Script`, or use the `multi shader pass`
to provide a factory class, or rely on special Mesh data. So each material is used in a different way.

Due to the particularity of various materials, a README document is provided under each material folder. For the
principle and usage of each material, please refer to the README document under each folder.
